Just another^55! repository

Oh hi world, IÂ´m just another dude that like typing like a hacker movie. 
Imagine been a dumb boy and finding a computer magazine and say: Oh shit i like this think i love computers
And a girl come for you and say: Hey boy do you wanna cracking the world
And you say: fuck yeah!
But when you see the computer you actually see uknown codes and shit that you say: OMG What its this?
And the lady see you and you see her and the both see us in a impractical dancing
cracking the world
discovering the new horizont 
the black hole that comsume all 
you
she
us
me
just typing for fun
just living in a ridiculus world of machines 
a humanity without fellings
apps and webs
video games and reds
the socity where we live 
its just another world of typing and code
its just a reality that we can hack
Hack the world
Be a Hacker Entity 
Be Free
